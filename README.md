# Storming-Physics
A purely operated C++ 2D Physics Engine.
This is the original version, when I was mainly just messing around with C++

The project has been later on transfered over to Parafield Studios for future plans to turn this into a full on Game Engine.

The original Repo has been made public to be used freely, enjoy!


# Requirements
- SFML 2.6
- A windows machine (Doubt this works with Mac or Linux)
